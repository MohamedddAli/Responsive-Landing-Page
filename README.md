## Project Description

I've uploaded these project files onto my gitHub respo.

This is a Landing page with a responsive navbar and active-section.

## Usage 

To use the responsive active-section feature just scroll onto a section and a box-shadow should appear.

And if you click on a section name from the navigation menu it should take you to the written section in a smooth way.

Keeping in mind there're some features that doesn't seem to work even though I believe the code is correct for e.g: the active status doesn't get added to the active nav bar item and the page doesn't scroll in a smooth way. apart from that everyhting works fine.
